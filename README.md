# Projects

### [Titanic Visualization with Seaborn](https://github.com/cgawlowski/portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Seaborn%20project%20-%20Titanic%20Survival%20Analysis.ipynb)
This project involved using the famous Titanic dataset to practice visualization skills with Seaborn. The aim was to recreate specific plots to understand the distribution and relationships within the data, v isualize the socio-demographic features of the Titanic passengers, and identify correlations between passengers' characteristics and their fates.

### 911 Emergency Calls Analysis
In this project, I analyzed 911 call data to derive meaningful insights. Handling emergency call data provided real-world experience in understanding patterns and trends, which can be vital for improving emergency response systems. The project emphasized data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to make informed decisions based on historical emergency call data.

### Bank Stock Prices During Financial Crisis
This project focused on the exploratory data analysis of bank stock prices during the financial crisis period, extending to early 2016. Analyzing stock data from major banks helped understand the impact of the financial crisis on the banking sector. This project highlighted the use of pandas and data visualization techniques to track financial performance, essential for financial analysts and economists.

### Ecommerce Customer Behavior Analysis
Working with an Ecommerce company's customer data, this project aimed to help the company decide whether to focus on their mobile app or website. By analyzing various customer metrics such as session lengths, time spent on the app, and website, the project provided actionable insights into customer behavior. This type of analysis is critical for businesses to optimize their digital strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Predicting Ad Clicks with Logistic Regression
In this project, I used logistic regression to predict whether a user would click on an advertisement based on their characteristics. Predictive modeling in digital marketing helps understand user behavior, enhancing the effectiveness of ad campaigns. The project demonstrated the application of logistic regression in a practical scenario, providing valuable experience in model building and evaluation.

### [Loan Repayment Prediction Using Random Forest](https://github.com/cgawlowski/portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Loan%20Repayment%20Prediction%20Using%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)
This project explored publicly available data from LendingClub.com to predict whether a borrower would repay their loan in full. Using random forest classification, the project aimed to assist investors in making informed decisions about potential borrowers. This type of analysis is crucial in financial services, where risk assessment and credit scoring are critical operations.

### Classifying Iris Species with SVM
Using the famous Iris flower dataset, this project employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features. The project showcased the use of SVMs for classification tasks and provided a foundation for more complex machine learning applications.

### [Clustering Universities with KMeans](https://github.com/cgawlowski/portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb)
The goal of this project was to use KMeans clustering to group universities into two categories: Private and Public. The project emphasized using unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in data without predefined labels. This type of clustering is widely used in various fields, such as market segmentation and customer classification.

### Yelp Review Classification Using NLP
In this natural language processing project, I classified Yelp reviews into 1-star or 5-star categories based on the text content. The project demonstrated the application of NLP techniques in sentiment analysis, which is highly valuable for businesses looking to understand customer feedback and improve their services.

### Bank Note Authentication with Deep Learning
This project utilized deep learning techniques to determine the authenticity of banknotes based on various image features. By applying neural networks to the Bank Authentication dataset, the project illustrated the effectiveness of deep learning in classification tasks. This type of project is crucial for understanding how neural networks can be applied in fraud detection and other security-related fields.
